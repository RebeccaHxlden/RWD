										<br/>
										<h2><span style="color: #ffffff;">EARLY LIFE AND HEALTH DECLINE </span></h2>
										<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Anneliese was raised a strict catholic and grew up being an obedient young woman described as bright and likeable, who showed her devotion to Christ. </span></p>
										<br/>
										<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In September 1968, whenever Anneliese was 16 years old, she experienced her first time of losing consciousness. Almost a year later, in August 1969, Annelise experienced another event of losing consciousness. </span></p>
										<br/>
																				<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/66/Anneliese_Michel_2.jpg" width="300px"style="float:right; padding: 20px;";/>
										<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Her mother then took her to see the family doctor and a neurologist who hypothesized she was having a form of seizure and would later be prescribed an anticonvulsant and an anti-seizure medication. </span></p>
										<br/>
										<h2><span style="color: #ffffff;">START OF THE SUPERNATURAL </span></h2>		
										<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In the Spring of 1973, Annelise began hearing knocking sounds in her bedroom, these sounds would also be heard by her sister. </span></p>
										<br/>
										<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">She would also begin hearing voices damning her to hell and furthermore her mother grew to be troubled whenever she witnessed Annelise staring angrily at a statue of Virgin Mary with &ldquo;Eyes turned black, jet black and her hands seemed to turn into thick paws with claws.&rdquo; </span></p>
										<br/>
										<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Annelise would later tell a neurologist she experienced horrific demonic visions of faces tormenting her, stated that she felt &ldquo;the devil was inside her&rdquo;, and reported smelling burnt faeces. </span></p>
										<br/>
										<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In Autumn of 1973, she met with a Freudian psychiatrist and was diagnosed with neurotic with possible epilepsy, and another neurologist reported finding she had &ldquo;epileptic patterns.&rdquo; They then switched her medication to a much stronger anti-seizure medication. </span></p>
										<br/>
										<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In the Summer of 1975, her condition worsened with her praying all throughout the night and eating spiders and flies. People around her reported her having &ldquo;superhuman strength&rdquo; and was seen squeezing an apple with one hand until &ldquo;fragments exploded throughout the room&rdquo;. </span></p>
										<br/>
										<h2><span style="color: #ffffff;">EXORCISMS AND DEATH </span></h2>
										<img src="https://pbcdn1.podbean.com/imglogo/ep-logo/pbblog1760870/anneliese-restrained.jpg" width="500px";/>
										<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">On September 24th, 1975 the first exorcism was held, and Father Renz allowed for some of the exorcisms to be recorded. </span></p>
										<br/><p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Then in May her condition further worsened with her biting herself, banging her head against the wall, refusing to eat saying she was &ldquo;not permitted to eat&rdquo;. </span></p>
										<br/><p><span style="color: #ffffff;">On June 30th, 1976 she had her last exorcism, saying only &ldquo;Please, absolution&rdquo; the entire time. </span></p>
										<br/><p><span style="color: #ffffff;">The next day her family went to check on her and found her dead. She died of starvation and dehydration at the age of 23 after 67 exorcisms weighing 68 pounds. &emsp;</span></p>
