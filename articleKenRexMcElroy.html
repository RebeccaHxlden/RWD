		<br/><p><span style="background-color: #ff0000; color: #000000;"><strong>Warning: Depicts extreme violence against women.</strong></span></p>
			<br/><h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Ken Rex McElroy was born on June 1<sup>st,</sup> 1934 into a family of poor tenant farmers who moved to Skidmore. Ken left school and was known to be illiterate. &nbsp;At 18-years-old he was injured when a steel slab fell on him in a construction site, which left him with chronic pain.</p>
			<br/><p>McElroy was 270LB and a Skidmore resident is quoted saying, &ldquo;I think Ken wanted to be big and important and wanted to be feared when he walked down the street. &ldquo;</p>
			<br/><p>Despite his chronic pain and lack of education, McElroy made a good living off leasing land and trading dogs. However, it is known he was in constant trouble with the law and his lawyer estimated he was charged with more than 3 crimes a year.</p>
			<br/><p>McElroy would intimidate witnesses by following them and watching him until they no longer would testify. His alleged crimes were robbery, assaulting women, property damage, threatening lives and assault, which included shooting two innocent people.</p>
			<br/><h2>Crimes</h2>
			<p>McElroy was accused of raping two women, as young as 12 years old. Both women he &lsquo;married&rsquo; to keep them from testifying against him. One of these women was Trena McCloud, who was present at the time of McElroy&rsquo;s death. McElroy was known to prefer girls around the age of 13 or 14. Entered a relationship with Trena around 14 years old, having a child with him.</p>
			<br/><p>Trena attempted to escape the marriage with McElroy by going to her parent&rsquo;s house, to which he responded by burning the family home down and shooting the family dog. However, in a later interview with Trena, she claimed the fire was due to &ldquo;faulty wiring&rdquo;. It is suspected she would downplay McElroy&rsquo;s crime as she was a victim of domestic abuse.</p>
			<br/><p>Trena was also reported saying, &ldquo;The officers were always hassling him&hellip;they&rsquo;d accuse him of anything, even things I know he didn&rsquo;t do because I was with him. They just hated him because he wouldn&rsquo;t kneel to them.&rdquo;</p>
			<br/><p>It is said by the residents of Skidmore that even the officers were afraid of encountering McElroy, as he had a reputation of always carrying a firearm and was known to shoot at police. The people of Skidmore felt abandoned by the justice system for two decades and couldn&rsquo;t get McElroy to stop terrorizing them.</p>
			<br/><h2>The event that would change McElroy&rsquo;s luck.</h2>
			<p>This would change on April 25<sup>th</sup>, 1980, in a general store owned by Ernest &ldquo;Bo&rdquo; Bowenkamp, the store clerk would ask McElroy&rsquo;s 8-year-old daughter to return some candy she had stolen. Whenever McElroy learned of this incident, he became enraged and began stalking the Bowenkamp family.</p>
			<br/><p>This led to an event on July 8<sup>th</sup>, 1980, when McElroy would drive into the alleyway behind the general store and then threated Bo Bowenkamp, then shot him in the neck at close range with a shotgun, which marked the second time McElroy had shot someone. Remarkably Bo Bowenkamp survived, and McElroy was arrested and charged with attempted murder.</p>
			<br/><p>On June 25<sup>th</sup>, 1981 a new district attorney had joined the court as the old one had left, he was called David Baird. He was only 3 years out of law school, but he accomplished what no other prosecutors could: he convicted him of a crime. However, McElroy would be released from prison in 2 years.</p>
			<br/><p>McElroy was quoted saying &ldquo;The jury convicted me... and they gave me two years. But I&rsquo;ll tell you what, I&rsquo;ll never go to jail. I&rsquo;ll appeal and get off. I&rsquo;ve been fighting the law since I was 13, and I&rsquo;m damn near 50. I&rsquo;ve been arrested for over fifty-three felonies and this is the first one I ever lost&rdquo;.</p>
			<br/><h2>The Final Straw</h2>
			<p>On July 10<sup>th</sup>, 1981 there was a town meeting regarding what they would do about McElroy. As many as 60 Skidmore attended. The sheriff suggested forming a neighborhood watch, which no-one agreed with. The summary of the meeting can be summed up by a quote of an attendee: &ldquo;We simply felt that the system had failed us&hellip; we all knew what McElroy was like, and there he was again and again. It seemed like nobody could stop him&rdquo;.</p>
			<br/><p>Those at the meeting heard reports that McElroy and Trena were at the D&amp;G Tavern, which was just down the road. They then adjourned the meeting and all 60 people descended to the tavern and surrounded McElroy&rsquo;s truck.</p>
			<br/><p>McElroy lit up a cigarette. Trena turned around to look behind her when she saw someone pull out a rifle, aim it at McElroy and then shots were fired which shattered the glass of the truck. McElroy remained in the car, dead from multiple gunshots. No witnesses called an ambulance. No witnesses but Trena would come forward to testify.</p>
			<br/><h2>A Quote on the Silence that Followed</h2>
			<p>Bo Bowenkamp&rsquo;s daughter watched the shooting take place from her window and said, &ldquo;Once the shroud of silence fell, there was going to be no-one talking&hellip; they could have pushed and dug, pushed and dug and gotten nothing. We were so bitter and so angry at the law for letting us down that it came to somebody taking matters into their own hand... no-one has any idea what a nightmare we lived&rdquo;.</p>
			<br/><p>The district attorney could not press any charges on anyone, and the case quickly went cold.</p>
