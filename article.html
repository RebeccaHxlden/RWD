					<br/><p><span style="background-color: #ff0000; color: #000000;"><strong>Warning: Depicts extreme violence against women.</strong></span></p>
					<br/><h2><span style="color: #ffffff;">Early Life</span></h2>
					<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Bundy was born on November 24<sup>th</sup>, 1946 in Burlington, Vermont (bordering New York and Massachusetts). Bundy's started life as his mother's skeleton in the closet, as his illegitimate birth shamed her religious parents.</span></p>
					<br/><p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Bundy started showing an interest in the macabre around 3 years old with him gaining a fascination around knives. He was shy but smart, however, he excelled in school but not amongst his peers.</span></p>
					<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MmMiGiQPNLI/maxresdefault.jpg" width="300px"  style="float:right; padding: 20px"/>
					<br/><p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Once Bundy became a teenager, a darker side of his personality began to appear notably, he enjoyed peering into other people's windows and started committing home burglaries.</span></p>
					<br/><h2><span style="color: #ffffff;">College</span></h2>
					<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Bundy&rsquo;s managed to graduate from the University of Washington with a degree in psychology in 1972. All seemed to be going well for Bundy as he had been accepted to law school in Utah, though he would never gain his degree.</span></p>
					<img src="https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article17146370.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/3_Elizabeth-and-Molly.jpg" width="300px"  style="float:right; padding: 20px"/>
					<br/><p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Bundy&rsquo;s life would change whenever he met Elizabeth Kloepfer, a pretty and wealthy young woman from California with plenty of influence. They were together for 7 years in an on-off relationship, they then split up which devastated him.</span></p>
					<br/><p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Many of Bundy's later victims resembled his college girlfriend. Young women, college-students with long, dark hair parted down the middle.</span></p>
					
					<br/><h2><span style="color: #ffffff;">Murders</span></h2>
					<img src="https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/01/15/00/8528342-6591793-image-m-3_1547511406899.jpg" width="300px"  style="float:right; padding: 20px"/>
					<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Bundy had confessed to killing 36 women across several US states between 1974 and 1978, although experts believe he may have killed 100 or more women.</span></p>
					<br/><p><span style="color: #ffffff;">His serial killer signature was typically sexually assaulting the victim, then killing them via blunt-force trauma or strangulation.</span></p>
					<br/><p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Most often, he would lure his victims into his car (VW Beetle) by pretending to be injured and asking for their help, which leads them to their death.</span></p>
					<br/><h2><span style="color: #ffffff;">Capture</span></h2>
					<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">In Autumn 1974, he moved to Utah with the intention of attending law school, and women began disappearing there as well. Furthermore, in 1975, he was pulled over by the police. A search of his vehicle uncovered an array of burglary tools (crowbar, face mask, rope and handcuffs). He was arrested for possession of these tools and then the police linked him to the murders.</span></p>

					<br/><h2><span style="color: #ffffff;">Execution</span></h2>
					<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">Ted Bundy was executed in Florida&rsquo;s 'Old Sparky' electric chair on January 24th, 1989 around 7 a.m. A hooded executioner flipped a switch which sent 2,000 volts of electricity through the convicted serial killer and rapist's body. After the execution, crowds of people outside set off fireworks.</span></p>
